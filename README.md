# Flappy-Bird-Game
This Java project is a simple implementation of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird. The code uses the LibGdx library to handle the game's graphics and user input. The main goal of the game is for the player to navigate a bird through a series of pipes by tapping the screen to make the bird fly.
